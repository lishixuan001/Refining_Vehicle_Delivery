# Redefining Vehicle Delivery with Autonomous Cars
> 2019 GM Student Competition <br>
> Fall 2018 IEOR 162 Final Project

## Goal
The project aims to create a model (simulation) about the vehicle delivery industry. Vehicles, as cargos, are delivered from 
Vehicle Distribution Centers (VDC) to Dealers. Details are contained in project introduction document. 

## Solution
We select to design an optimization solution to considering both static and dynamic routes. Since the VDCs only knows the demand
of the current day and two days after, we design the model in a way that it optimizes vehicle transferrance between VDCs and Dealers
thus all demands are satisfied and the total cost is minimized. There are two models developed for this process. More assumptions 
and solution details are exalained in the project report
